    "# Sentiment Analysis (Employee Feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply sentiment analysis to the employee feedback data regarding the Two-Pot system, we can follow these steps using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This approach will help us categorize the feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Text Cleaning**: Start by cleaning the feedback text to remove any noise. This includes eliminating punctuation, special characters, and numbers. Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Split the cleaned text into individual words (tokens) to analyze the sentiment at a word level.\n",
    "- **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words (e.g., \"and\", \"the\", \"is\") that do not contribute to sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Extraction\n",
    "- **Vectorization**: Convert the cleaned and tokenized text into numerical format using techniques such as:\n",
    "  - **Bag of Words**: Count the occurrences of each word in the feedback.\n",
    "  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Assigns weights to words based on their frequency across all feedback, emphasizing more informative words.\n",
    "- **Word Embeddings**: Consider using pre-trained models like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture semantic meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sentiment Classification\n",
    "- **Sentiment Lexicons**: Utilize sentiment dictionaries (e.g., AFINN, VADER) that assign sentiment scores to words. Words can be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral based on their scores.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Models**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines) using labeled data (feedback with known sentiment) to classify new feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Post-Processing\n",
    "- **Aggregate Results**: After classifying individual pieces of feedback, aggregate the results to provide an overview of overall sentiment towards the Two-Pot system.\n",
    "- **Visual Representation**: Create visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) to illustrate the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) among the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interpretation\n",
    "- Analyze the results to draw insights about employee perceptions. Identify common themes in positive or negative feedback to understand the workforce's sentiment towards the Two-Pot system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, we can effectively categorize employee feedback and gain valuable insights into how the Two-Pot system is perceived, guiding further improvements or adjustments as necessary.\n"
