    "# Sentiment Analysis of Employee Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply sentiment analysis to categorize employee feedback as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the following steps would be involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Before analyzing the sentiment, it's important to clean and prepare the text data:\n",
    "- **Lowercasing**: Convert all feedback text to lowercase to ensure consistency.\n",
    "- **Removing Stop Words**: Words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\" are not useful for sentiment and can be removed.\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Break down the feedback into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Reduce words to their base form, e.g., \"appreciates\" becomes \"appreciate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sentiment Classification\n",
    "Sentiment analysis typically uses pre-trained models or rule-based approaches to classify the sentiment. Hereâ€™s how it would apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assign Sentiment Scores**: For each feedback, assign sentiment scores using either:\n",
    "  - **Lexicon-based methods**: Pre-defined dictionaries like VADER or SentiWordNet that assign a positive, negative, or neutral score to individual words.\n",
    "  - **Machine Learning**: Use supervised learning where labeled data is used to train a model. For example, feedback could be labeled as positive, negative, or neutral based on pre-existing sentiment labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of feedback categorization:\n",
    "- **Positive Sentiment**:\n",
    "  - \"I like the flexibility of the system.\"\n",
    "  - \"I appreciate having access when needed.\"\n",
    "  - \"The locked pot gives me peace of mind.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  These comments reflect positive feelings toward the system, expressing satisfaction and appreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Sentiment**:\n",
    "  - \"It's difficult to save enough for retirement.\"\n",
    "  - \"The system is too complex for me.\"\n",
    "  - \"The withdrawal limits are too strict.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  These reflect frustration, complexity, or dissatisfaction, signaling negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neutral Sentiment**:\n",
    "  - \"More education on long-term savings would help.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  This feedback is neutral, offering constructive suggestions without strong positive or negative emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Categorizing Sentiments\n",
    "Once the sentiment score is computed for each feedback, it is categorized into:\n",
    "- **Positive**: Scores above a certain threshold indicate positive sentiment.\n",
    "- **Negative**: Scores below a threshold indicate negative sentiment.\n",
    "- **Neutral**: Scores near zero or within a middle range are considered neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Output Interpretation\n",
    "After categorizing the feedback:\n",
    "- A summary could show the percentage of feedback that is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "- This provides insights into overall employee satisfaction with the Two-Pot system.\n",
